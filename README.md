##Features
- A circle animation expands and contracts to help visualize and focus on breathing.
- Gentle vibrations allow users to use the app even if they are not looking at the screen, and this vibration can be set to one of three types: a fancy vibration pattern on inhale and exhale, a fancy vibration on inhale only, or a simple double tap. And if users don't like vibrations, they can just turn it off!
- The background colour and circle colour are completely customizable.
- The duration of the breathing as shown on the main menu can be optionally set to be equal to the duration of the last breathing session. The number of breaths per minute can also be changed. 
- For heart-rate enabled smartwatches, the number of breaths taken per minute can be set dynamically based on the current heart rate, and the current heart rate is shown at the top of the screen during the breathing session. Thanks to [JohnEdwa](https://github.com/JohnEdwa)!
- The main screen displays how many minutes they have breathed using this app. It also displays the number of steps taken today, a greeting, the user's current heart rate, or nothing at all depending on their settings.
- A reminder can be set (every 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6 hours) as a prompt to breathe. The time at which this begins can also be changed in the settings. This reminder can also be snoozed for any increment of 10 minutes up to 50 minutes.
- App Glance to show how many minutes the user breathed in the last session. This can be set to show the current daily total, or be disabled completely. Thanks to [PiwwowPants](https://github.com/PiwwowPants)!
- Supports English, French, Spanish, and German (text in app, settings page all correspond to the watch's chosen language). Thanks to [noiob](https://github.com/noiob) for the German translation!
